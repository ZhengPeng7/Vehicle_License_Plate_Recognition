# Summary on Vehicle_Lincense_Plate_Recognition

Through the mission, I've reviewed or learnt:
1. Preprocessing images with different lights and shapes, and set suitable conditions to threshold them.
2. Converting img <--> tfrecords -> array **systematically**, which saved me quite a lot of time.
3. Applying Lenet to the recognition.
4. Saving the model, and applying restored Lenet to different datasets.
5. Doing statistics on the Recall Rate(took me a really long time).
